libcryptui (3.12.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * Depend on gnupg instead of transitional gnupg2

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8, no changes needed.

libcryptui (3.12.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Laurent Bigonville ]
  * Drop debian/patches/01_autostart_path.patch: Almost all the .desktop files
    have moved to /etc/xdg/autostart and the patch is useless anyway as
    nothing in the code uses the define.

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * debian/copyright: Use https for copyright headers
  * debian/watch: Use https and use new "special strings"
  * Have seahorse-daemon depend on gnupg2 to match seahorse

  [ Andreas Henriksson ]
  * Have quilt refresh d/p/02_seahorse-daemon_libcryptui_static_link.patch
  * Add debian/patch/git_allow-gpg2-2.1.patch (Closes: #834008)

 -- Andreas Henriksson <andreas@fatal.se>  Mon, 15 Aug 2016 18:01:29 +0200

libcryptui (3.12.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ Jackson Doak ]
  * New upstream release

  [ Andreas Henriksson ]
  * Bump debhelper build-dependency to >= 9 to match debian/compat
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5

 -- Andreas Henriksson <andreas@fatal.se>  Sat, 12 Jul 2014 14:39:59 +0200

libcryptui (3.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Change section of gir1.2-cryptui-0.0 to introspection.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Remove MA: same statements for the -dev package, because it depends
    on the gir package which is not MA compatible.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in:
    + Update (build-)dependencies.
    + Remove Build-Conflicts on gnupg2. libgpgme11 depends on it and
      gets pulled because of libgpgme11-dev. The build conflict comes
      from seahorse's packaging and shouldn't be needed here.
  * debian/patches/99_ltmain_as-needed.patch:
    + Removed. Instead...
  * debian/rules:
    + Pass --as-needed to dh_autoreconf so it does the --as-needed magic.
      The patch was useless before as we were calling autoreconf after
      applying the patch.

libcryptui (3.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on Seahorse's packaging.
  * This library is split from the seahorse source, so the soname bump is
    kept.
  * Introduce a new seahorse-daemon package. Make it Break seahorse < 3.2.
  * Let libcryptui0a depend on seahorse-daemon, as the D-Bus service is
    required.
  * Add Breaks for older seahorse and seahorse-plugins, as there was a
    small unannounced API break.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Add a libcryptui-doc. Add necessary Replaces/Breaks.
  * Add Multi-Arch support:
    - Bump debhelper & cdbs.
    - Add Pre-Depends.
    - Fix install dirs in *.install.
    - Use the M-A dir as $libdir.
    - Mark libcryptui0a Multi-Arch: same.
    - Mark seahorse-daemon Multi-Arch: foreign.
    - Mark libcryptui-doc Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Add debian/patches/02_seahorse-daemon_libcryptui_static_link.patch, by
    Michael Biebl: create a noinst libcryptui-private.la, and link
    seahorse-daemon against it to avoid a dependency loop between
    seahorse-daemon and libcryptui which requires the D-Bus service.
  * Don't pass obsolete --with-pgp.
  * Pass --enable-gtk-doc, and Build-Depend on libgtk-3-doc to ensure correct
    cross-references.
  * Move locales to seahorse-daemon.
  * Add -Wl,-z,defs to LDFLAGS.
  * Update copyright.
